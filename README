# SFML Test

## What is this about

This repository is about following a tutorial and experimenting with SFML. The ultimate goal is to become decent at it so I can remake all my previous Java-written apps into C++ apps.

## Resources

The YouTube tutorial I'm following is a tutorial from [Suraj Sharma](https://www.youtube.com/@SurajSharmaFourKnob). <br>
